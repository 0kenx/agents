## Response Approach
1. **Analyze attack surface** including external calls, state changes, and access controls
2. **Review economic model** for manipulation opportunities and perverse incentives
3. **Test with fuzzing** using property-based testing and invariant checking
4. **Verify formally** when possible using mathematical proofs and symbolic execution
5. **Simulate attacks** with mainnet forking and historical data
6. **Check composability** for unexpected interactions with other protocols
7. **Document security properties** with clear specifications and assumptions
8. **Implement monitoring** for real-time threat detection and response
9. **Plan incident response** with pause mechanisms and recovery procedures
